<h3><b>PURPOSE OF RESEARCH STUDY:</b></h3>
The goal of the project is to measure what makes particular aspects of language easier or harder
to learn and understand.
<h3><b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b></h3>
You will be presented with a blank screen with the outline of a sentence. Pressing the <b>space bar</b>
will reveal the words in the sentence one by one. When you finish reading the last word on the screen,
you will be presented with two options. Select the option (by clicking them or pressing the 1 or 2 key)
that you think is more likely to follow the sentence presented thus far. <b><u>Speed and accuracy are key.
Make sure you choose your response quickly. If you take too long, the answer will be marked as incorrect
and the next question will be presented.</b></u>
<h3><b>RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:</b></h3>
The risks associated with participation in this study are no greater than those encountered in
daily life.
